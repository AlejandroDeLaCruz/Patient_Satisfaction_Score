# Patient Satisfaction Score

This repository includes a SQL query for processing hospital data from two datasets:
  <ul>
    <li>v1 HCAHPS 2022</li>
    <li>Hospital Beds</li>
  </ul>

The analysis aims to gain insights into how hospitals in the United States deliver quality care to patients and to identify areas where hospitals could improve their overall care.

Skills applied: JOIN, Window Functions, Common Table Expressions (CTE), Date Functions, String Functions, and Data Conversion

### Data Processing  
  <li>Utilizing a string function in making sure that </li>
